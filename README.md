Formats your recipes into an easy-to-use tree.  

The Mathematica code is defunct and removed-- Check it out in the history    

Intended to be to be simple, lightweight (no json, minimal formatting cruft), and mnemonic (interpret through the lens of intuition+ex-perience)    

Some example recipes are given in lieu of real documentation ;)    

Use: Run the .sh file (see .sh) from /recipes/    

Recipes and output are in /recipes/{text, pdf,latex}    

Known issues:    
* The shell script is fucked, redo this    
* newline character will change-- It's nice to be able to use /
* Some characters are Bad. They should be replaced automatically.

In the future:    
* Untrack ALL recipes EXCEPT for test input and output
* DVG, PNG output instead of PDF???
* Changes to the recipe format?    
* Metadata: Citations (ha) and comments    
* Pretttiness    
* More recipes once the format is stabler
